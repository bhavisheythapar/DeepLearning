# DeepLearning

This repository contains deep learning projects for binary image classification. Currently there are two projects in this repo:

1. Image Classification Using Vanilla Neural Networks
2. Image Classification Using Convolution Neural Networks

The first project shows the limitations of using a simple Neural Network to classify images.
